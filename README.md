## About the Project

## Training the Agent

The blue cube in this project has been trained using reinforcement learning techniques to touch the purple cube before chasing the orange cube. This was achieved by defining a reward function that incentivizes the agent to touch the purple cube before chasing the orange cube. The reward function is designed to give a higher reward to the agent when it touches the purple cube and a lower reward when it chases the orange cube without touching the purple cube.

The agent's behavior is trained using the Unity ML-Agents toolkit, which provides a framework for training intelligent agents using deep reinforcement learning. The toolkit allows developers to define the agent's behavior using a combination of neural networks and reward functions, and then train the agent using a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Demo

Check out the project on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Paulleukefeld/HunterAgent) to see the trained agent in action!

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the project, make sure you have the necessary tools and dependencies set up.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PaulLeukefeld/HunterAgent`
2. Install Unity: Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/), then add the project to Unity Hub.
3. Set up Python environment: Follow the [ML-Agents Installation Guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Installation.md) to create the required Python environment.


## Interacting with the Agent

1. After cloning this repository, you can interact with the trained agent in a Unity environment.
2. Launch the Unity scene and observe the trained agent's behavior.
